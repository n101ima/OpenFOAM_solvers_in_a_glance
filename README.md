# OpenFOAM_solvers_in_a_glance
This repository contains a comprehensive table summarizing various solvers available in OpenFOAM, a popular computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software package. The table categorizes the solvers based on different aspects such as incompressible flow, compressible flow, multiphase flow, molecular dynamics, stress analysis of solids, etc.

Each solver entry in the table includes detailed information on its category, features, advantages, disadvantages, and applicability to various physical phenomena. The table provides insights into whether a solver supports features such as compressible flow, heat transfer, multiphase flow, turbulence modeling, chemical reactions, electromagnetics, solid mechanics, dynamic meshing, parallel computing, and more.

Users can utilize this table to identify the most suitable solver for their specific CFD simulations, considering factors such as the nature of the problem, required features, and computational efficiency. The provided overview aims to streamline the solver selection process and enhance the usability of OpenFOAM for the broader community.

Contributions to the repository, including corrections, additions, or improvements to the solver overview table, are encouraged. The goal is to create a comprehensive and accurate resource that benefits users in their simulation endeavors.
